## Getting started

1. Install node.js for Mac: http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs

2. Install npm:

   Get https://npmjs.org/install.sh and install with `sh install.sh`. Make sure to install npm 1.1.16 or
   above. If you have an older version of npm, you'll need to do `sudo npm uninstall npm -g` before
   re-installing.

   Also you need the following global npm packages:
   ```bash
   $ npm install -g npm
   $ npm install -g node-gyp
   ```

3. Install the node packages using npm:
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```


## Testing

Unit tests live in the folder "test".  Unit tests are based on the "jest" framework.
Run tests with the command:
```bash
$ gulp test
```
